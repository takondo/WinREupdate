# WinREupdate

This is a sample PowerShell script to help automate the patching of WinRE images on Windows 10 and Windows 11 machines. Run the script with Administrator privileges on affected platforms. There are 2 scripts based on the version of Windows you are running. Please use the appropriate version for your environment.
- PatchWinREScript_2004plus.ps1 : This is for Windows 10 version 2004 and newer, including Windows 11
- PatchWinREScript_General.ps1  : This is for Windows 10 version 1909 and older, but executes on all versions.

This script will:
1. Mount the existing WinRE image
2. Updates the WinRE image with the specified package
3. Unmount the WinRE image
4. If the BitLocker TPM protector is present, re-establish the trust between BitLocker and WinRE
